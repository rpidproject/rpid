# RPID Project

## Overview

It has become good data practice to use persistent identifiers (PIDs) to identify digital data products whether a product is a collection, a file, or an object of some type. Naming solutions for digital data products eventually resolve a PID down to the digital object it identifies, but **the current landscape is limited by multiple solutions with weak interoperability, and inconsistent protocols** for getting from PID to data object. In a world of increasing PID use, we will soon be awash with billions of PIDs that all resolve to data objects using various inconsistent and unpredictable approaches, making it difficult to build higher level services that cross the various approaches. 

In this 12+24 month project, **we will stand up and support a robust PID testbed** (called the RPID testbed (pronounced "rapid") to stimulate and enable evaluation of powerful new complementary outputs of the [Research Data Alliance](https://www.rd-alliance.org) (RDA) in PID oriented data management. The testbed is **responsive to data driven priorities in science and education**, specifically as part of the cyberinfrastructure ecosystem that accelerates a broad spectrum of data-intensive research (NSF Director unveils 2016). The advancements developed and tested here we believe have the **transformative magnitude to stimulate an entire ecosystem of new discovery services** for research data.

## Services
   * Handle Service - Development services can be seen at https://handle-dev.grid.iu.edu:8080

   * RDA Collections WG API. End of Summer '17 
   * RDA PIT API - enhanced to work with PID Kernel Information profile; available as a downloadable SDK. End of Summer '17

## Open Access for Data Science Researchers

### Usage Policies
   * The RPID testbed can be used for research, education, non-profit, or pre-competitive use
   * The RPID testbed assigns only test handles, allowing for exploratory work. 
   * Handles assigned by the testbed will be on a project basis, to avoid collisions. Your prefix will be 11723.9.test.\(proj name)
   * Projects interested in using the testbed are strongly advised to join the RPID User Advisory Group
   * Follow the work at https://github.com/rpidproject.  
   * To join the RPID User Advisory Group or otherwise reach us, we are at rpid-l@iu.edu

### Requesting Access
   * Please contact the RPID working group at rpid-l@iu.edu to get started.   You will register your project, be assigned a prefix, and can then start using the services.
