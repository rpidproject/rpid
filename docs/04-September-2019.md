### Presentations, Papers, Reports, and AOB
   * Meeting with GOFAIR in DC
      * 30 Minutes Tuesday Morning "Early Implementation Issues"
      * RPID Background and structure
      * 3-5 Slides on "Early Implementation Issues"
      * Bug resolution (communication), AAI mechanisms (user registration to use API), UI development takes intimates knowledge of RPID at this point (still obscure), "test-bed" classification (adoption), intellectual issues (mapping, granularity, interoperability, merging data), still trying to tell our story to new potential adopters (education). 
      * Non-Issues - Operations on test-bed scale, porting service from AWS to baremetal to Openstack was easy, migration of DTR data simple (even with a format change). 
      * Unknown - If existing software libraries (Azure or AWS) will easily plug-and-play with ERPID services. If not, additional development effort will be necessary. Can "Types" be used as level of indirection? Will Types work as we envision them.
