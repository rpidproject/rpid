Naming solutions for digital data products eventually resolve a PID down to the digital object it identifies, but \nthe current landscape is limited by multiple solutions with weak interoperability, and inconsistent protocols\n for getting from PID to data object. In a world of increasing PID use, we will soon be awash with billions of PIDs that all resolve to data objects using various inconsistent and unpredictable approaches, making it difficult to build higher level services that cross the various approaches. \n\n\nIn this 12+24 month project, \nwe will stand up and support a robust PID testbed\n (called the RPID testbed (pronounced \"rapid\") to stimulate and enable evaluation of powerful new complementary outputs of the \nResearch Data Alliance\n (RDA) in PID oriented data management. The testbed is \nresponsive to data driven priorities in science and education\n, specifically as part of the cyberinfrastructure ecosystem that accelerates a broad spectrum of data-intensive research (NSF Director unveils 2016).
